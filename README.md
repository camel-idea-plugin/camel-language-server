# camel-language-server

camel-language-server is a server implementation that provides Camel DSL smartness.
The server adheres to the [language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)
and can be used with any editor that supports the protocol. The server utilizes [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/).

# Clients

These clients are available:
* [Eclipse IDE](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-eclipse)
* [VS Code](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-vscode)
* [Eclipse Che](https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/8648)
* [Atom Editor](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-atom)

Manual configuration is possible with:
* [Sublime Text](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-sublime)
* [CodeMirror](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-codemirror)

Help is welcome to provide more client implementations, especially for:
* [Emacs](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-emacs)
* [Eclipse Theia](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-lsp-client-theia)

## Features

### Code completion for Camel URI with XML DSL
* Completion for Camel components ![Completion for Camel components](./images/completionComponent.png "Completion for Camel components")
* Completion for Camel attributes ![Completion for Camel attributes](./images/completionAttribute.png "Completion for Camel attributes")
* Completion for Camel attributes value ![Completion for Camel attributes value](./images/completionAttributeValueForChoice.png "Completion for Camel attributes value")

### Hover on Camel URI with XML DSL

On hover, the documentation of the Camel component is available.
![Hover on Camel components](./images/hoverComponent.png "Hover on Camel components")

### Diagnostics (a.k.a. Validation) on Camel URI with XML DSL

On save, diagnostics on Camel URIs are updated:
![Diagnostic on Camel URI](./images/diagnostic.png "Diagnostic on Camel URI")

### Camel K modeline support

* Completion for:
  * option names
  * trait definition names
  * trait property names
  * Camel artifact id for dependency
  * mvn dependency
  * Camel component properties
  * resource-like properties (`resource`, `open-api`, `property-file`). It is providing relevant sibling files filtering out some IDEs configuration folders (`.vscode`, `.settings`, `.theia`).

### WebSocket support

Connection through WebSocket is supported. The server needs to be launched with `--websocket` option.

The following extra parameters can be used:
* `--port=<port>`, default value is `8025`
* `--hostname=<hostname>`, default value `localhost`
* `--contextPath=<contextPath>`, default value `/`. It must start with a `/`.

Then, the connection can be made through
`ws://<hostname>:<port><contextPath>/camel-language-server`.

For information, with all defaults, it is `ws://localhost:8025/camel-language-server`.

## Specific version of Camel catalog

It is possible to specify a specific version of the Camel catalog. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:

```
{
	"camel": {
		"Camel catalog version" : ...
	}
}
```

To use Red Hat Integration productized version, the Red Hat Maven GA repository needs to be configured on the host running the Camel Language Server. To configure it, follow these steps:
* Copy the [default grape config file corresponding to the version used by Camel](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/GROOVY_2_5_8/src/resources/groovy/grape/defaultGrapeConfig.xml) into _~/.groovy_ folder and call it _grapeConfig.xml_
* Add `<ibiblio name="fuse" m2compatible="true" root="https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/"/>` inside the chain node

For more information, check the [Grape official documentation](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html#Grape-CustomizeIvysettings).

## Additional Camel components

It is possible to specify a list of additional Camel components. This can be provided as Initialization Option or Workspace Configuration. The format is the same for both:

```
{
	"camel": {
		"extra-components" : [
			...
		]
	}
}

```

## Document symbol support

There is document symbol for Camel Contexts and routes, on XML and Java DSL. In UI, for instance with VS Code, it means there are an outline, a breadcrumb and a Go To Document Symbol command.

![Outline](./images/outline.png "Outline")
![Go to Symbol](./images/goToSymbol.gif "Go To Symbol")
![Breadcrumb](./images/breadCrumbXml.gif "Breadcrumb")

## Features planned

* As you type reporting of parsing and compilation errors
* More advanced Code completion
* Code outline
* Code navigation
* Code lens (references)
* Highlights
* Code formatting

## Feedback

* File a bug in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-language-server/issues).
